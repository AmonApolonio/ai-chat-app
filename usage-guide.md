# Usage Guide

This guide walks you through how to interact with the Chat App and get the most out of its features.

## Getting Started

After launching the application (see the [README.md](README.md) for setup instructions), you'll be presented with the chat interface. The app has two primary modes of operation:

1. **Research Mode** (default): Search for company and business information
2. **PDF Mode**: Upload and query PDF documents

## Using Research Mode

Research mode is designed to provide information about companies and business topics by searching the web for current information.

### Examples:

#### Basic Company Query
```
Tell me about Microsoft
```
The system will search the web for current information about Microsoft, including company overview, financials, recent news, and leadership.

#### Industry Analysis
```
Tell me about the electric vehicle industry
```
The system will provide information about the current state of the electric vehicle industry, key players, trends, and market forecasts.

#### Company Comparison
```
Compare Apple and Google
```
The system will search for information about both companies and provide a comparative analysis of their business models, financials, and market positions.

#### Financial Query
```
What are the latest earnings for Amazon?
```
The system will search for Amazon's most recent financial results and provide a summary of key financial metrics.

## Using PDF Mode

PDF Mode lets you upload a document and ask questions about its contents.

### How to Use PDF Mode:

1. Click the "PDF Mode" button in the chat interface
2. Upload a PDF document by:
   - Clicking the upload area and selecting a file, or
   - Dragging and dropping a file onto the upload area
3. Wait for the "PDF Uploaded Successfully" confirmation
4. Ask questions about the document's content

### Examples:

After uploading a PDF about climate change:

#### General Content Query
```
What is this PDF about?
```
The system will provide a summary of the document's main topics and themes.

#### Specific Information Query
```
What does the document say about carbon emissions?
```
The system will search the document for information specifically about carbon emissions and provide relevant content.

#### Data Extraction
```
What statistics are mentioned in the document?
```
The system will extract and summarize key statistics, numbers, or data points mentioned in the PDF.

#### Finding Sections
```
Does this document have a conclusion or recommendations section?
```
The system will check if such sections exist and provide their content if found.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your question, the more focused and helpful the response will be.

2. **Stay On-Topic**: In Research Mode, the system is trained to provide information only about companies and business topics. It will politely decline to answer questions on other subjects.

3. **Provide Context**: When asking follow-up questions, include context from previous messages if needed.

4. **Upload Clear Documents**: For PDF Mode, ensure documents are text-searchable (not just scanned images) for best results.

5. **Check Source Links**: In Research Mode, responses often include source links for more information. Check these for additional details.

6. **Refresh for Large PDFs**: If you're uploading a very large PDF and experience issues, try refreshing the page and uploading again.

## Troubleshooting

- **PDF Upload Fails**: Ensure your PDF is not larger than 10MB and is a valid PDF format.
  
- **No Response**: If the system seems stuck, try refreshing the page and starting a new session.
  
- **Rate Limited**: The system includes rate limiting to prevent abuse. If you receive a rate limit message, wait a minute before trying again.
  
- **Research Results Not Current**: The system searches the web for information but might not have real-time data for very recent events.
  
- **PDF Results Not Accurate**: If PDF responses seem inaccurate, ensure your PDF has proper text content (not just images of text) that can be processed by the system.
